# JAX Course

This repository collects the material for the JAX seminars given at BCAM on late 2022 - early 2023, as well as some tutorial-style examples for dealing with specific and recurrent programming problems. It consists on a series of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try) with explanations, examples, exercises and references that can be followed at any time.
